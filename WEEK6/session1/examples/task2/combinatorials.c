/**
 * @brief recursively calculates the factorial of an integer n.

 * @param n number to find factorial of.
 * @return int n factorial.

int factorial(int n) {
  // the base case - this dictates when the recursion should stop
  if (n == 0) {

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  /*
  The program should accept a command line argument as follows:
  ./combinatorials n C r
  ./combinatorials n P r

  where n and r are both positive integers, and r is always less than or equal
  to n.

  for example:
  ./combinatorials 7 C 2

  Your program should then calculate and print out the correct result

  nCr should return the total combinations of r items out of n.
  This is calculated by: n! / (r! (n - r)!)

  nPr should return the total permutations of r items out of n.
  This is calculated by: n! / (n-r)!

  Add appropriate validation to your program to make your code robust.

  You should try and use functions to write your program.
